h1. How to extend the activities rendering



h1. Objective
In this article you will learn how you can implement a preprocessor for activities rendering.

h1. Requirements
You need to be familiar with the eXo Kernel component model and its xml configuration. You also need be able to program in java.


h1. Why would you need to do this ?

An simplistic activity is made of simple text.  We have created an extension point at the level of activities renderting for two cases :
* support more html tags
* support @mentions

But you may want to support a special syntax like :
* #hashtags to feel like twitter
* smileys to look like skype
* [Markdown|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown] to be as cool as Buzz ;-)

You can imagine more sophisticated processing. And not only text-related because a processor actually has full access to the Activity. So you can very well process based on the owner, the app, mediaitem, etc..
h1. Writing an ActivityProcessor
eXo Social let's you pre-process an activity before it is returned by the ActivityManager. To do this you simply need to implement the interface ActivityProcessor :

{code}
/**
 * An activity processor is responsible to pre-process an activity before it is returned by the {@link ActivityManager}
 */
public interface ActivityProcessor {

  /**
   * Process an activity
   * @param activity the activity. It can be modified
   */
  void processActivity(Activity activity);

  /**
   * Priority of this processor.
   * All activity processors will be executed in ascending priority order
   * @return
   */
  int getPriority();

}
{code}


For example let's implement a SmileyProcessor that will replace text smileys by icons :

{code}
public class SmileyProcessor implements ActivityProcessor {

  String smiley =  "<img src='/images/smiley.gif'/>";

  public void processActivity(Activity activity) {
    String title = activity.getTitle();
     activity.setTitle(title.replaceAll(":-\\)", smiley));
  }

  public int getPriority() {
    return 100;
  }

}
{code}

h1. Configuring the processor

Now that you have a nice procesor you need to hook it to the system.
At runtime, processors can be attached to the ActivityManager via the method ActivityManageraddProcessor(ActivityProcessor processor).

But there is also a component plugin hook for it :   public void addProcessorPlugin(BaseActivityProcessorPlugin plugin)

So to make your processor easy to hook, you simply need to let him extend the BaseActivityProcessorPlugin.

{code}
public class SmileyProcessor extends BaseActivityProcessorPlugin {

  String smiley =  "<img src='/images/smiley.gif'/>";

  public SmileyProcessor(InitParams params) {
    super(params);
  }

  public void processActivity(Activity activity) {
    String title = activity.getTitle();
      activity.setTitle(title.replaceAll(":-\\)", smiley));
  }
}
{code}

It will have the additional benefit to make the priority field configurable so you don't need to implement getPriorty().

Then your processor can be configured as a component plugi like this :

{code}
  <external-component-plugins>
    <target-component>org.exoplatform.social.core.activitystream.ActivityManager</target-component>
    <component-plugin>
      <name>SmileyProcessor</name>
      <set-method>addProcessorPlugin</set-method>
      <type>org.example.SmileyProcessor</type>
      <init-params>
        <value-param>
          <name>priority</name>
          <description>priority of this processor (lower are executed first)</description>
          <value>2</value>
        </value-param>
      </init-params>
    </component-plugin>
  </external-component-plugins>
{code}

Restart, place the smiley gif on the server and you should see something like that  :


!activity-smiley.png!
